# smCore
This is pre-alpha quality so please don't run it on a production server.

# Installation
You need to get two Symfony components ( https://github.com/symfony/Yaml and https://github.com/symfony/Finder) and add them to your /library/ directory before smCore will run.


# Miscellaneous

1. It's not set up very well. Sorry about that, I'll clean it up as soon as I remember that I wrote this.

2. I tend to break things. I also change my mind a few times a week and make stupid coding decisions just as often. I usually notice my mistakes sooner or later, though.
